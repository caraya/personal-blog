Deepfakes have been possible for a long time so why have they become so prevalent now that we have AI?

What has changed is how easy it has become to create deepfakes, how widespread the ability has become and how we've openly declared what we'll use the technology for.

Early deepfakes were easier to spot. There were parts of these deepfake images that had obvious deficiencies for those who knew where to look. That has become significantly harder with the advent of AI.

This post is more of a cautionary tale about the evolution of technology and the dangers it can pose if we're not careful.
