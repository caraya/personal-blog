Deepfakes have been possible for a long time so why have they become so prevalent now that we have AI?

What has changed is how easy it has become to create them, how widespread the ability has become, how easy it has become to target people, and how we've openly declared what we'll use the technology for.

Early deepfakes were easier to spot.  There were parts of these deepfake images that had obvious deficiencies for those who knew where to look. AI has worked to reduce those deficiencies to where deepfakes are not harder to spot.

This post is meant as a cautionary tale about the evolution of technology and the dangers it can pose if we're not careful.

## A brief history

According to [Face/Off: Changing the face of movies with deepfakes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10325052/):

> Deepfakes are a type of manipulated media created using artificial intelligence technologies [1]. Deepfakes most often consist of videos where an artificial face has been superimposed onto another person’s face, resulting in a highly convincing recording of someone doing or saying something that they never did [2]. While computer-generated imagery is not a new technical development, the rise of deepfakes and the development of deepfake creation apps promises an especially realistic product without significant training or expensive equipment [3], and research has shown that most individuals cannot reliably distinguish AI generated faces from real faces [4].

The history of deepfakes starts in academic study, when, as early as the 1990s, the idea of using artificial intelligence for image processing was investigated.

in 1997 Researchers at Interval Research published [Video Rewrite](http://chris.bregler.com/videorewrite/) along with a SIGRAPH paper.

However, deepfakes were not widely recognized until the middle of the 2010s. An important turning point was the development of neural networks and the introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in 2014. These GANs, developed by Ian Goodfellow and others, were the foundation for deepfake technology, allowing for increasingly complex and lifelike manipulations.

Initially, the creation of deepfakes required significant computational resources and technical expertise, limiting their use to researchers and hobbyists. The early examples, while intriguing, often lacked the realism that today’s deepfakes possess. However, as technology progressed, so did the quality and accessibility of deepfakes. Open-source projects and user-friendly applications began to emerge, democratizing the ability to create convincing deepfakes. This ease of access has led to a surge in the production and distribution of deepfake content across the internet.

The realism of deepfakes has reached levels that are not just convincing but often indistinguishable from genuine content. This leap in realism is attributed to improvements in AI algorithms, increased computational power, and the vast availability of data to train these models. The deep learning systems behind deepfakes have become adept at analyzing and replicating human features, expressions, and voice patterns with unnerving precision.

One of the most significant advancements in deepfake technology is the ability to manipulate video and audio in real-time. This has opened the door to live deepfake applications, where individuals can appear as someone else during video calls or streams. The implications of this advancement are far-reaching, extending beyond mere entertainment to realms like politics, where the potential for misuse is a growing concern.

The rise of deepfakes has also been fueled by the proliferation of social media and the increasing consumption of digital media. Platforms, where videos are easily shared and viewed by millions, provide a fertile ground for the spread of deepfakes. This widespread dissemination, coupled with the human tendency to trust visual and auditory content, has made deepfakes an effective tool for spreading misinformation and disinformation

### The dangers of digital performers

Deepfakes like the de-aging of Grand Moff Tarkin and Princess Leia in Rogue One were done by professional Visual Effect (VFX) shops for specific situations and with permission from the subjects' estates.
