In the last post, we looked at building and configuring an Eleventy website.

This post will look at creating content for the site including: Migrating old content from WordPress, creating additional templates, creating partials, creating short codes and other types of Eleventy content.

## Expanding the work

### Creating Additional Templates

### Creating Partials

### Creating Shortcodes

## Content

### Migrating Existing Content

Before we start, we need to make sure that we have the data we need. I created a WordPress converter to Markdown using Go.

Rather than discuss the code here, I've put it in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/caraya/wp-converter)

The result is not perfect and will require a lot of work on individual posts, but less than if we had to do manual conversions. It is also important to point out that I will not use all the migrated content, I chose not to be selective in what I converted.

### Creating Content

### Adding Content

## Putting it all together

## Looking at what's next
