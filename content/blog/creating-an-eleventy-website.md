I used WordPress until 2023 when I became disappointed as to the direction the project was going towards and how much harder blocks make it to create bespoke designs the way I'm used to.

So I decided to move to [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) because most of the sites I build are static and have no server-rendered components to them.

My first project was to move my web technology blog to Eleventy. There are still some issues I have to address, like auto-posting to Twitter/X when new posts are published but, on average, it has been really good.

So now I'm thinking of a new project to replace my old personal blog that was removed from the old host and hasn't been updated in a while.

This post will outline the process of creating the new site, the mistakes I made on the WordPress site and the creation and population process of the new Eleventy site.
