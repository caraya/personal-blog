title: Temporal is about to reach stage 4

People who have been waiting for the Temporal proposal, and for browsers to release their implementations unprefixed, have reason to be happy :)

IETF has approved [draft-ietf-sedate-datetime-extended](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sedate-datetime-extended/), which was the last block before moving Temporal to stage 4 in the [TC-39 process](https://tc39.es/process-document/).

Now, short of major implementation issues reported to TC39, this should move to stage 4 once two interoperable implementations ship in browsers.

Using the [Temporal polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/temporal-polyfill) provides a spec-compliant workaround for the API until browsers implement it natively.

I discussed using the polyfill along with examples of how the API works in [Revisiting the TC39 Temporal proposal](/revisiting-the-tc39-temporal-proposal/)
