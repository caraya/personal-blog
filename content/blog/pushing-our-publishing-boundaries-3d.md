One of the things that attracted me to 3d was the expressive possibilities of the medium and how we can incorporate these possibilities into a traditional publishing paradigm without having to resort to very expensive tools like the ones used for animation and CGI effects.

[Mr. Doob](http://www.mrdoob.com/) is the creator of [Three.js](http://threejs.org/) arguably the most popular WebGL develoment framework in use today.

In the first video, Mr. Doob and [AlteredQualia](http://alteredqualia.com/), another Three.JS developer, talk about Three.JS and its future. The presentation also acts as a technical introduction to the library.

The second presentation by Mr. Doob talks about how to make 3d more accessible to people who may not be familiar or comfortable with bare WebGL or OpenGL technologies.
