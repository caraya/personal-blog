I've been busy writing content but there are things that I'm either long overdue in implementing or want to explore.

This should keep me busy when

* Dark Theme
  * Re-evaluate the existing color palette and come up with a decent dark color palette
  * Use the [light-dark()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/light-dark) function to
* Web Components
  * Color.js [elements](https://elements.colorjs.io/) &mdash; Lea Verou
    * Be mindful that these components are under development and they may change without notice
  * [playground-elements](https://github.com/google/playground-elements) &mdash; Google
  * [share-url](https://nigelotoole.github.io/share-url/) to create share links for different platforms
  * Evaluate if [Wired Elements](https://wiredjs.com/) or [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style/) would be good libraries to experiment with for UI components
  * Can you create web components to handle footnotes?
    * Would it make sense to bring [Lit](https://lit.dev/) to create a set of custom elements?
    * What would these components be?
* Preferences Panel
  * Font size
  * Dark mode
* Improve search
* Tidy up the HTML
* Evaluate strategies for automatically sharing links to X/Twitter and Mastodon, **ideally without having to pay for the service**
* Once you're done playing with custom elements, update [My Markdown Cheatsheet](https://publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/my-markdown-cheatsheet/)
