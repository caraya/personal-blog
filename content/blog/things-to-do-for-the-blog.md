I've been busy writing content but there are things that I'm either long overdue in implementing or want to explore.

This should keep me busy when not writing posts and working on other projects.

* Dark Theme
  * Re-evaluate the existing color palette and come up with a decent dark color palette
  * ~~Use the [light-dark()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/light-dark) function to simplify the color schemes~~
* Web Components
  * Color.js [elements](https://elements.colorjs.io/) &mdash; Lea Verou
    * Be mindful that these components are under development and they may change without notice
    * Is forking at this point worth consideration?
  * [playground-elements](https://github.com/google/playground-elements) &mdash; Google
  * [share-url](https://nigelotoole.github.io/share-url/) to create share links for different platforms
  * Evaluate if [Wired Elements](https://wiredjs.com/) or [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style/) would be good libraries to experiment with for UI components
    * Be particularly mindful that Shoelace, in its new incarnation as Web Awesome, has paid components that may or may not make it to the free version and that many of the features that would make them attractive are for paid customers only without any certainty when/if they will become part of the open source project
  * Can you create web components to handle footnotes?
    * Would it make sense to use [Lit](https://lit.dev/) to create a set of custom elements?
    * What would these components be?
* Preferences Panel
  * Does it make sense to create a preferences panel?
    * Font size
    * Dark mode
* Improve search
* Tidy up the HTML
* Evaluate strategies for automatically sharing links to X/Twitter and Mastodon, **ideally without having to pay for the service**
* Once you're done playing with custom elements, update [My Markdown Cheatsheet](https://publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/my-markdown-cheatsheet/)
