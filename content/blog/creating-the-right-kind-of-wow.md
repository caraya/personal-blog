I had to see this presentation multiple times yesterday and today before I realized what she actually meant. I've been guilty of wanting the WOW! the immediate surprise at the latest and greatest bells and whistles.

But that's not what she meant and that's not what we should be concentrating on. We should be concentrating on the wow that makes people change their view of a subject or topic.
