CSS has progressed enormously in the last few years.

This is both good and bad.

The good: CSS has become very powerful and it has gained many new features that make design and development work easier.

The bad: it has become hard to keep in your head and, even, to know what you're looking for in references like [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/), [web.dev](https://web.dev/) or your favorite resource.

This post will try to create a blueprint for people starting up with CSS today.
