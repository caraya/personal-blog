CSS has progressed enormously in the last few years.

This is both good and bad.

The good
: CSS has become very powerful and it has gained many new features that make design and development work easier.

The bad
: It has become hard to keep all of CSS in your head and, even to know what you're looking for in references like [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/), [web.dev](https://web.dev/) or your favorite resource
: CSS has also evolved in both the length of the specification and the content it covers. CSS 1 was 68 pages long while CSS 2, released 2 years later, was 300 pages. After version 2 was released, the CSS Working Group (CSSWG) decided to split features into their own standalone specifications to reduce the time it would take for a feature to be part of a recommendation rather than slow down the entire specification because some features are not ready

This post will try to create a blueprint for people starting up with CSS today. It will also advocate for a less-than-pixel-perfect approach to using CSS.

This post assumes that understand the following CSS terms and how they work:

* [The Cascade](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Cascade),
* [Specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity)
* [Importance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/important)

## What can we do with CSS?

I know that this sounds like a weird question but bear with me for a section or two.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages. Even at this most basic level, there are a lot of things to learn

Here's a partial list of things beyond layout and formatting that you can do with CSS.

* **Animations and Transitions**: Create smooth transitions between states and complex animations for elements
* **Responsive Design**: Adapt the layout to different screen sizes and orientations using media queries
* **Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements**: Style elements based on their state (`:hover`, and `:focus`) or parts of an element (`::before` and `::after`)
* **Custom Properties (Variables)**: Define reusable values for properties to maintain consistency and simplify updates
* **Transformations**: Apply transformations such as scaling, rotating, and skewing to elements
* **Clipping and Masking**: Create complex shapes and control the visibility of parts of an element
* **Filters**: Apply graphical effects like blur, brightness, and contrast to elements
* **Blend Modes**: Define how an element's content should blend with its background
* **Custom Fonts and Typography**: Use web fonts, control typographic details, and implement responsive typography
* **Shapes**: Wrap text around complex shapes and **elements**
* **Variables and Calculation**: Perform calculations directly within CSS using the `calc()` function
* **Multicolumn Layouts**: Create and style text in multiple columns
* **Container Queries**: Changes the size of elements based on their parent's dimensions
* **Backdrops and Overlays**: Use `backdrop-filter` to apply effects to the background of elements
* **Scroll Snap**: Create smooth, snappable scrolling experiences for users
* **Paged Media Styles**: Define styles specifically for printed versions of webpages.

The trick is not to get overwhelmed with how many things are available, what to learn, or how to use them.

## So where do we start?


## Be The Browser's Mentor, Not Its Micromanager

We don't have to create exactly the same layout for all browsers on all platforms and all operating systems. Instead, provide guidance and let the browser build the site in a way that if a browser doesn't support a given technology it will still work just not the same way as it would if everything was supported.

## Peeking at Intrinsic Web Design

Another concept that you've probably heard of is Intrinsic Web Design, coined by Jen Simmons in 2018.
