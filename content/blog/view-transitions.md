The View Transition API makes it easy to change the DOM in a single step, while creating an animated transition between the two states.

While it's true that we have animation tools already, they are not well suited for in-page transitions like the ones we want to do here.

View transitions will work in both SPA and regular web apps (also called MPA). However they are only available in Chromium browsers for SPAs at this time.
